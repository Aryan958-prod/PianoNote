# PiaNote

## PREFACE


- The **PiaNote** is a Java desktop game that allows users to improve their music note recognition skills in a very fun and interactive way. The game will play a music note and the user has to correctly identify the notes by clicking on the correct note from the options given.

- The application is suitable for any music student, beginners or anyone interested in improving their musical accuracy.

- I am a passionate songwriter and coder. Creating a very simple music game that helps people to learn and practice music notes aligns with my interest in both programming and music writing. It is a very fun and nerdy way to combine these two passions of mine into a single project.
